//! Tensor Core Gen 5 (tcgen05) for Blackwell architectures (sm_100+).
//!
//! tcgen05 is Blackwell's tensor core instruction set, replacing WGMMA from Hopper.
//! The key architectural change is **single-thread MMA semantics** - one thread can
//! issue an entire matrix multiply operation.
//!
//! # Key Differences from WGMMA
//!
//! | Aspect | WGMMA (Hopper) | tcgen05 (Blackwell) |
//! |--------|---------------|---------------------|
//! | MMA issue | 128 threads collectively | **1 thread** |
//! | Matrix A/D storage | Registers/SMEM | **Tensor Memory (TMEM)** |
//! | Allocation | Implicit | **Dynamic (tcgen05.alloc)** |
//! | Wait mechanism | `wgmma.wait_group` | **mbarrier.try_wait** |
//!
//! # Tensor Memory (TMEM)
//!
//! TMEM is a new per-SM memory type for tensor operands:
//! - Dynamically allocated at runtime
//! - Allocation unit: 32 columns (range: 32-512)
//! - One WARP must perform allocation (warp-synchronous)
//! - Must be explicitly deallocated before kernel exits
//!
//! # Thread Semantics

//! # Usage Pattern
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use cuda_device::tcgen05::*;
//! use cuda_device::barrier::*;
//!
//! // 1. Allocate TMEM (warp-synchronous - all 32 threads in warp)
//! if warp_id() == 0 {
//!     tcgen05_alloc(tmem_addr_ptr, 64);  // 64 columns
//! }
//! sync_threads();
//!
//! // 2. Single thread issues MMA
//! if thread_id() == 0 {
//!     tcgen05_fence_before_thread_sync();
//!     tcgen05_mma_ws_f16(d_tmem, a_tmem, a_desc, b_desc, idesc, false);
//!     tcgen05_commit(&mbar);
//! }
//!
//! // 3. All threads wait via mbarrier
//! mbarrier_try_wait(&mbar, 0);
//!
//! // 4. Deallocate TMEM (warp-synchronous)
//! if warp_id() == 0 {
//!     tcgen05_dealloc(tmem_addr, 64);
//! }
//! ```
