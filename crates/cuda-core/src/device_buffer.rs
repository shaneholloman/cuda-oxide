//! Owning device memory buffer with ergonomic host-device transfer methods.
//!
//! [`DeviceBuffer<T>`] is analogous to `Vec<T>` on the host: it owns a
//! contiguous allocation of `len` elements on the device and frees it on
//! drop. Unlike cudarc's `CudaSlice`, the buffer carries no stream reference
//! and no hidden event tracking -- the stream is an explicit parameter on
//! every transfer operation, making data-flow and synchronization transparent.
//!
//! # Quick start
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let a_dev = DeviceBuffer::from_host(&stream, &a_host)?;
//! let c_dev = DeviceBuffer::<f32>::zeroed(&stream, N)?;
//! // ... kernel launch ...
//! let c_host = c_dev.to_host_vec(&stream)?;
//! ```
